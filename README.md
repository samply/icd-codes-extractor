# icdo3-extractor

Extracts ICD-O-3 codes from a PDF file (`resources/sitetype.icdo3.20220429.pdf`) and dumps it in a CSV file (`resources/icdo3_full.csv`).

## Motivation

These codes had to be translated from German to English, and to avoid this pain, the generated CSV file can be used from any language and the codes translated to any desired data structure.
